# Textures to display Japanese characters, using Google's Noto font

This mod adds characters texture to allow the Font API mod (from [display_modpack](https://github.com/pyrollo/display_modpack)) to display Japanese characters.

This mod includes hiragana, katakana and an amount of kanjis that is probably complete but excessive.It also includes uppercase and lowercase latin letters.

Be warned that it weights 31 MB uncompressed. In future versions I shall restrict the amount of ideograms to the most commonly used (there are currently the 20 000 kanjis defined by the unicode standard, but far less are in common use.)
