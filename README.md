# Textures to display Japanese hiragana and katakana characters, using Google's Noto font

This mod adds kana characters texture to allow the Font API mod (from [display_modpack](https://github.com/pyrollo/display_modpack)) to display the syllabic Japanese characters.

This mod includes uppercase, lowercase and many accentuated latin letters, hiaragana, katakana and a huge amount of kanjis that is probably complete but excessive.

Be warned that it weights 31 MB uncompressed. In future version I shall restrict the amount of ideograms to the most commonly used (there are currently the 20 000 kanjis defined by the unicode standard)
